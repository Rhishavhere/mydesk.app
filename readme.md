## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Before running, you need to tell the app where to find your backend APIs.

1.  Open the `src/constants/devices.js` file.
2.  Update the `baseUrl` for each device to point to your public domain or local IP addresses.

```javascript
// src/constants/devices.js

export const DEVICES = [
    {
        name: 'My Desktop',
        endpoint: '/desktop',
        baseUrl: 'https://example.com' // Your public domain or local IP
    },
    {
        name: 'My Laptop',
        endpoint: '/laptop',
        baseUrl: 'https://example.com' // Your public domain or local IP
    },
];
```



## üîó Backend Requirement

This frontend is just one half of the magic. It requires the corresponding **[myDesk Backend (oneCloud)](https://github.com/Rhishavhere/onecloud)** to be running on your target devices. Make sure they are active and accessible at the URLs you specified in the configuration.
